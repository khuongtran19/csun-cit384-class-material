       1. Methodology for Deployment
       2. Images and Containers
          - docker ps: list of all of the active *containers*

          - docker images:
          - docker rm | rmi: removes an container or a container
          - docker start | stop: starts/stops a container
          - docker run: creates a new container and builds all intermediate images as needed.
            - docker pull: 
            - docker build: build an image
            - docker create: build a container
            - docker start:
            - docker exec:
        

       3. Recall from CIT160
          * ``docker run --name hello-world hello-world``
          * ``docker build -t cit160 etc``
          * ``docker create --name cit160 --interactive --tty --volume ${PWD}:/mnt/laptop-cit160 cit160``

       4. ``docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -`` < Dockerfile
          * CONTEXT=https://github.com/csuntechlab/docker-cgi.examples.git
          * ``docker build $CONTEXT``
             -  curl http://cit384-steve.csun.edu/

       5. Docker File:
          - ARG VERSION=latest
          - FROM base:${VERSION}
          - LABEL

          - WORKDIR
          - ADD
