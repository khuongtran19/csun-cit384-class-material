# Lecture Notes for September 22, 2021

 
## Agenda 22th
  1. Pickup from last time, i.e., questions, etc.
     1. reviewed how to use the socket CLI tool
        - used to fake-out the client side or server side
        - done to triage, to, and to experiment
     1. re-re-review of the CGI protocol
        - a set of well-defined environment varibles, e.g. GATEWAY_INTERACE
        - read the HTTP request body from (which file) stdin
        - write any HTTP response headers to (which file) 
        - write the HTTP response body to (which file) stout
        - what do with the stderr file? create and send to log file


  1. Quick review
  1. More Content Generators
     - asis handler
     - cgi handler
     - html handler


  1. HTTP/s Server Overview
     1. Accept Request:
        1. socket();  # Buying the phone
        1. listen();  # Phone is read to hear someone call
        1. LOOP
           1. accept();
           1. fork();

  1. Read HTTP Request (partially)
     1. Read Request Line: e.g., 
        - GET /\~steve/ HTTP/1.1   : HTTP_METHOD, URI, PROTOCOL
     1. Read the header values (store them some place)
     1. Read the blank line
     1. Defer reading body

  1. Call in turn, each of the input filters

  1. Rewrite the URI into the filename
     - /\~steve/cgi-bin/emit-cgi-env.cgi  
     - /home/users0/ccs/steve/public_html/cgi-bin/emit-cgi-env.cgi 
     - Apache Directives
       1. DocumentRoot /var/html/
       1. UserDir public_html
           - lookup the home directory of \~steve
           - append ${UserDir}
           - append the rest of the URI

  1. Invoke the Contenter Generator (Handler)
      1. AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
      1. AddHandler send-as-is  asis
      1. ~Addhandler plain-html .html~


## Content-Generator: .html
     1. Write media type in the head:   content-type: plain/html
     1. write blank line
     1. cat the filename.html

## Content-Generator: asis
     1. Read the first line: status: 200 Cool
     1. Transform that line to:  HTTP/1.1 200 
     1. Add two fields:
        - Date:
        - Server:
     1. cat the rest of the file


## Content-Generator: .cgi
     1. Fork() and rewire fds
     1. Marshall environment variables
     1. exec cgi program





## Lab Assignment:
  1. To be provided at the start of the lab
  1. To be completed by the end of the assignment
